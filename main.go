package main

//This file is written for instruction only

// an example of pass by value :

//import "fmt"

//The initial value is B.

//Newly assigned variables are copied and the original value does not change.

//var outer_str = "A"

//func MF(mystr string) {

//mystr = "B"

//}

//mf(outer_str)

// output :

//value of inner = B
//value of  outer = A

//In general, pass by value means a copy of it is made and this copied
//value is given to the function.
//Then the object performs the relevant operation on this copied value
// and keeps the original value unchanged.
