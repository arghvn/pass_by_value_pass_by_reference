//The term pass by reference means that there is generally
// a value of this variable and all operations refer to this variable.
// All operations know where this value is.

//This file is written for instruction only

// an example of pass by Reference :

//import "fmt"

//var outer = "A"

//func MF(inner *string){

//The MF function here is a variable that receives a
//pointer and a string. In fact,
// the address that points to the string.

//	*inner = "B"

//Inside the function of existence * and inner means go to the value of inner.
//inner is an address. Change the value of inner into memory and put B.

//}

//Finally we call the function.

//Existence & means create an address from the outer variable and give it an address.

//MF(&outer)

//output :

//value of inner = B
//value of outer = B
